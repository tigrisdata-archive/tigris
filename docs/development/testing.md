# Testing

For different test use cases FDB is configured as follows:

### Docker tests / GitHub action tests

Can be run using `make test`, this runs both unit and integration tests
In this case auto-generated cluster file is shared between containers
using Docker volume.

Mounted at:

* /var/fdb/fdb.cluster in tigris_fdb container
* /etc/foundationdb/fdb.cluster in tigris_test and tigris_server 
containers, which is default location, so no need to pass cluster file to 
the init function

Docker compose file sets "test" config environment variables so 
`getTestFDBConfig` passes empty cluster file.

### Running unit and integration tests on the host (server in the docker)

FDB and server should be started using `make run`. The tests then can be 
run using `make local_test`.

Between FDB and server, config file is shared the same way as in fully 
docker tests, described above.

Go tests use `config/fdb.cluster` file for connection, which is 
configured by `getTestFDBConfig` function.

### Running unit and integration tests in IDE (server in the docker)

Same as hosts tests containers should be started using `make run`

After that individual tests can be run in the IDE.

Unittests are using `config/fdb.cluster` for connecting to FDB and 
configured by `getTestFDBConfig`

### Integration tests with server running on the host

In this case FDB can be started as follows: 

```shell
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up tigris_fdb
```

Server can be compiled by `make bins`, the server then can be started 
manually on the host by running `server/service` in the root of the repository

The server uses `config/config.yaml` in this case which is configured to use 
`config/fdb.cluster` file

# Known issues

  * There is a network issue when server is run on the Mac OS X host. The server 
cannot connect to the FDB container, which exposes port 4500 on the localhost.

    So it should be started using `make run`
